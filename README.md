# heart-disease-prediction-model
This project uses machine learning to analyze health-related data and predict whether a person is at risk of developing heart disease. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis using data-driven insights so that medical professionals can make better decisions.




# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. It is built in Python and includes:

- Data analysis and model training in Jupyter Notebook
- A saved ML model
- A simple Streamlit web app for making predictions

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is for learning and educational purposes only. It must **not** be used for real medical diagnosis.
